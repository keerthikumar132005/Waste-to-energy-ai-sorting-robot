# Waste to Energy AI Sorting Robots - Project Overview

## Project Goals

The **Waste to Energy AI Sorting Robots** project aims to develop a system that:

1. Uses AI-driven robots to classify and sort waste items into categories such as recyclable, organic, and non-recyclable.
2. Converts organic waste into energy, measuring the energy output and optimizing it for efficiency.
3. Provides real-time data to users through a dashboard and allows for conversational interactions with a chatbot interface.

## Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

1. **AI Sorting Robots** - Robots equipped with sensors, an AI model, and actuators to detect, classify, and sort waste.
2. **Backend** - A Laravel-based API that handles data from robots, provides real-time data to the dashboard, and responds to chatbot queries.
3. **Frontend** - A Vue.js application that provides an interface for real-time monitoring (dashboard) and interaction (chatbot).

## Main Components

- **AI Model**: A machine learning model used by robots for waste classification.
- **Chatbot Interface**: Allows users to ask questions about system performance, waste data, and energy output.
- **Dashboard**: Displays real-time metrics on waste sorting and energy generation.
- **Data Storage**: Stores waste and energy data, allowing for analytics and historical insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Laravel, MySQL, Redis (for caching)
- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Axios
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow Lite (for waste classification)
- **Deployment**: Vultr (or similar cloud provider) for cloud infrastructure
